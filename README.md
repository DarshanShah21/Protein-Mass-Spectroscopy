# Protein-Mass-Spectroscopy

In this project, we were given the data based on Protein Mass Spectroscopy. The given data resembles about mass (m/z) of 
each amino acid and its intensity which are related to diseases that can infect human beings. I had to analyze the factors
affecting the quality of protein mass with explanatory data analysis and also applied machine learning tools on the same.
